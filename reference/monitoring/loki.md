# Loki logs

The following table lists all the charms used as part of Charmed HPC that expose logs to {term}`Loki`, and the
corresponding query to see the exported logs in {term}`Grafana`.
Follow the [Visualize log data](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/visualize/grafana/#grafana-explore)
tutorial from the Grafana documentation for instructions on where and how to query for Loki logs.

## Ignoring log files

By default, every instance of the `opentelemtry-collector` charm will log all the files in the `/var/log` directory.
This is sometimes not ideal, since it increases the amount of logs stored by Loki which are unrelated
to the running application. A solution for this is to set the `path_exclude` configuration for
`opentelemetry-collector`, which will allow it to ignore such log files:

:::{code-block} shell
juju config opentelemetry-collector path_exclude="/var/log/{unattended-upgrades,apt,}/*.log"

# Security hardening guidelines

Charmed HPC is designed for security out-of-the-box but this guide serves as a companion to help tailor security measures to your environment.

For an overview of Charmed HPC security features see:

- {ref}`cryptography`

## Slurm

Slurm is the underlying workload scheduler for Charmed HPC and particular care should be taken with user-facing components such as the `sackd` login nodes and the REST API.

By default, Charmed HPC does not enable SSH access to the login nodes, other than through the `juju ssh` command available to administrators. Administrators should follow best practices for securing SSH servers when opening the nodes up to their cluster users. A non-exhaustive list of potential options includes:

- Use of SSH keys for authentication
- Enforcing use of strong, modern ciphers
- Use of [Fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban) or equivalent tool to block brute-force attacks
- Limiting access to particular IP ranges

For REST API security guidance, see:

- [Slurm REST API - Security](https://slurm.schedmd.com/rest.html#security)

## Cloud

Charmed HPC can be deployed on a variety of backing clouds. Security documentation for common clouds can be found at:

## Juju

Juju is the underlying orchestration engine for managing the Charmed HPC Slurm charms throughout their lifecycle. For general Juju security considerations, see:

- [Juju security](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/latest/explanation/juju-security/index.html)
- [Harden your Juju deployment](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/latest/howto/manage-your-juju-deployment/harden-your-juju-deployment/)

### Cloud credentials

When initializing a backing cloud with Juju, it is essential that the credentials provided have suitable access rights and permissions. For guidance see:

- {ref}`howto-initialize-cloud-environment`
- Juju's [List of supported clouds](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/latest/reference/cloud/list-of-supported-clouds/)

## Monitoring and auditing

Charmed HPC supports integration with the Canonical Observability Stack (COS) to provide system monitoring and logging, see:

- {ref}`howto-manage-integrate-with-cos`
- [Best practices for production deployments of COS Lite](https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-observability-stack/reference/best-practices)

## Operating system

Charmed HPC runs on the Ubuntu operating system. For documentation on Ubuntu security and compliance, see:

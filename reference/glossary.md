Walltime
    The maximum duration of a job declared in the job script. Serves as a limit after which the
    workload manager will forcibly end the job.

Workload manager
    Software responsible for accepting user jobs, placing them in a queue, and deciding where and
    when they will run on a cluster - the process known as: job scheduling. Optimizes utilization
    of a cluster by matching job requirements (CPU core count, walltime) to available hardware
    while enforcing site-specific usage policies. Slurm is a workload manager.

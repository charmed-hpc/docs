## Documentation guidelines

Please familiarize yourself with [Markedly Structured Text (MyST)](https://mystmd.org/), [DiÃ¡taxis](https://diataxis.fr/), and the [Canonical Documentation Style Guide](https://docs.ubuntu.com/styleguide/en/index) as they will help you better understand how
Charmed HPC's documentation is put together.

## Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker is the preferred way for tracking [bug reports](#bug-reports) and [enhancement proposals](#enhancement-proposals), but please follow these guidelines for the issue tracker:

* Please __do not__ use the issue tracker for personal issues and/or support requests.
The [Discussions](#discussions) page is a better place to get help for personal support requests.

* Please __do not__ derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on track and have respect for the other
users/contributors.

* Please __do not__ post comments consisting solely of "+1", ":thumbsup:", or something similar.
Use [GitHub's "reactions" feature](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)
instead.
  * The maintainers of Charmed HPC's documentation reserve the right to delete comments
  that violate this rule.

* Please __do not__ repost or reopen issues that have been closed. Please either
submit a new issue or browse through previous issues.
  * The maintainers of Charmed HPC's documentation reserve the right to delete issues
  that violate this rule.

## Issues and Labels

The Charmed HPC documentation issue tracker uses a variety of labels to help organize
and identify issues. Here are a few of these labels, and how the maintainers of
Charmed HPC's documentation use them:

* `docs` - Issues for general revision and enhancement of Charmed HPC's documentation.
Can also be used for pull requests.

* `help wanted` - Issues where we need help from the HPC community to solve.

* `good first issue` - Issues that the Charmed HPC documentation maintainers have determine are a suitable level for first time documentation contributors. 

For a complete look at Charmed HPC's documentation labels, see the
[project labels page](https://github.com/charmed-hpc/docs/labels).

## Bug Reports

A bug is a *demonstrable problem* that is caused by errors in Charmed HPC's
documentation. Good bug reports make Charmed HPC's documentation better, so
thank you for taking the time to report issues!

> **_NOTE:_** For bug reports pertaining to code functionality, please post the bug report in the corresponding code repository rather than here. Bug reports here should focus on bugs within the documentation, such as a how-to command being displayed incorrectly, or the documentation setup itself not functioning as expected. 

Guidelines for reporting bugs with Charmed HPC's documentation:

1. __Validate your issue__ &mdash; ensure that your issue is not being caused by either
a semantic or syntactic error in your environment.

2. __Use the GitHub issue search__ &mdash; check if the issue you are encountering has
already been reported by someone else.

3. __Check if the issue has already been fixed__ &mdash; try to reproduce your issue
using the latest version of Charmed HPC's documentation.

4. __Isolate the problem__ &mdash; the more pinpointed the issue in the documentation
is, the easier it is to fix.

A good bug report should not leave others needing to chase you for more information.
Some common questions you should answer in your report include:

* What is your current environment?
* Were you able to reproduce the issue in another environment?
* Which steps from Charmed HPC's documentation produce the issue?
* What was your expected outcome?

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. All these details will help the
maintainers quickly fix issues with Charmed HPC's documentation.

Please make sure to select `bug` as the issue type and include any relevant labels, such as the affected component.

## Enhancement Proposals

Enhancement proposals can be posted to the Charmed HPC documentation issue tracker, using the `enhancement` issue type.

The Charmed HPC team may already know what they want to included in the documentation,
but they are always open to new ideas and potential improvements. GitHub Discussions is
a good place for discussing open-ended questions that pertain to the entire Charmed HPC
project, but more focused enhancement proposal discussion can start within the issue
tracker.

Please note that not all proposals may be incorporated into the documentation. Please
know that spamming the maintainers to incorporate something you want into the documentation
will not improve the likelihood of being implemented; it may result in you receiving a
temporary ban from the repository.

## Pull Requests and Contributing Process

Good pull requests &mdash; spelling corrections, revisions, new sections &mdash;
are a huge help. Pull requests should remain focused and not contain commits not
related to what you are contributing.

__Ask first__ before embarking on any __significant__ pull request such as adding new sections,
changing the layout, or heavily revising existing sections; otherwise, you risk spending a
lot of time working on something that Charmed HPC's maintainers may not want to merge into the
documentation! For small changes, or contributions that do not require a large amount of time,
you can go ahead and make a pull request.

Adhering to the following process is the best way to get your contribution accepted into
Charmed HPC's documentation:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork,
   and configure the remotes:

   ```shell
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   $ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/docs.git

   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   $ cd docs

   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:charmed-hpc/docs.git
   ```

2. If you cloned the documentation a while ago, pull the latest changes from the
upstream Charmed HPC documentation repository:

   ```bash
   $ git checkout main
   $ git pull upstream main
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch off the main development branch to
   contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   $ git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Ensure that your changes pass all tests:

    ```shell
    # Check links
    $ make linkcheck

    # Check spelling
    $ make spelling

    # Check inclusive language
    $ make woke

    # Check accessibility
    $ make pa11y

    # Ensure style guide compliance
    $ make vale
    ```
> **_NOTE:_** The current MAKEFILE setup assumes that you are using an Ubuntu OS. If not, or if running the tests locally is not ideal, you may run them within GitHub. To do so, make sure any local changes have been pushed to your personal fork+branch and are visible from the web interface, then, from the web interface for GitHub:
>  1. Go to the `Actions` tab near the top of the screen
>  2. Select `Automatic docs checks` on the far left
>  3. Select the `Run workflow` button on the right
>  4. Select the relevant branch from the drop-down menu
>  5. Select `Run workflow` within the drop-down
>
> For more information on setting up the tests locally, see [Automatic checks](https://canonical-starter-pack.readthedocs-hosted.com/latest/content/automatic_checks/) within the Canonical Starter Pack documentation.

6. Commit your changes in logical chunks to your topic branch.

   Our project follows the
   [Conventional Commits specification, version 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
   You can use Git's
   [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/) feature to
   tidy up your commits before pushing them to your origin branch.

7. Locally merge or rebase the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```shell
   git pull [--rebase] upstream main
   ```

8. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```shell
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

9. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) against the `main` branch by follow the guidelines and prompts within the Pull Request template that will generate when a pull request is started.


## Discussions

GitHub Discussions is a great place to connect with other Charmed HPC users to
discuss potential enhancements, ask questions, and resolve issues. Charmed HPC users
should remain respectful of each other. Discussion moderators reserve the right to
suspend discussions and/or delete posts that do not follow this rule.

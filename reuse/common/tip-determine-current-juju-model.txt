::::{dropdown} Tip: Switching between Juju models
`juju switch`{l=shell} can be used to determine the current model you're operating on:

:::{terminal}
:copy:
juju switch

charmed-hpc-controller:admin/slurm
:::

<!--
  This raw `<br>` element is here because :terminal: directive does not add padding to the
  bottom of the rendered block that the text is too close
-->
<br>

The output above shows that you're operating on the `slurm` model as the `admin` user
through the Juju controller `charmed-hpc-controller`.

`juju switch <model>`{l=shell} can also be used to switch between models:

:::{terminal}
juju switch identity

charmed-hpc-controller:admin/slurm -> charmed-hpc-controller:admin/identity
:::

<br>

The output above shows that you've switched from operating on your `slurm` model
to your `identity` model.

# Use Apptainer

Apptainer can be used as a container runtime environment on Charmed HPC for running
containerized workloads. This guide provides examples of using Apptainer on Charmed HPC
to accomplish different tasks.

:::{admonition} New to Apptainer?
:class: note

If you're unfamiliar with using Apptainer in your workloads, see the [Apptainer user quick start guide](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/latest/quick_start.html)
for a high-level introduction to using Apptainer on HPC clusters.
:::

## Prerequisites

To successfully use Apptainer on your Charmed HPC cluster, you will at least need:

- A [deployed Slurm cluster](#howto-setup-deploy-slurm).
- A [deployed shared filesystem](#howto-setup-deploy-shared-filesystem).
- An [active Apptainer integration](#howto-manage-integrate-with-apptainer).

Once you have verified that Apptainer is integrated with your Charmed HPC, refer
to the sections below for the different ways that you can use Apptainer on Charmed HPC.

## Create a container image

Apptainer can create container images on your cluster that can then be used within
your workloads. The sections below demonstrate the different ways Apptainer can create
container images on your Charmed HPC cluster.

### Using a pre-existing container image from a public container registry

Apptainer can pull pre-existing container images from public container registries.
For example, to pull a Valkey container image from Dockerhub and start a local
Valkey service on your cluster:

:::{terminal}
:copy:
:host: login

apptainer pull valkey.sif docker://ubuntu/valkey:7.2.10-24.04_stable
:::

:::{terminal}
:copy:
:host: login

apptainer overlay create --size 1024 valkey.img
:::

:::{terminal}
:copy:
:host: login

apptainer instance run --overlay valkey.img valkey.sif valkey

INFO:    instance started successfully
:::

:::{terminal}
:copy:
:host: login

apptainer exec instance://valkey valkey-cli ping

PONG
:::

Use `apptainer help pull`{l=text} to see the full list of public container registries
Apptainer can pull container images from.

### Building your own custom container image

:::{admonition} Before attempting to build your own container images
:class: warning

Check with your cluster administrator before attempting to build container images
on your Charmed HPC cluster. Each site has different policies about whether you
can build container images directly on your cluster, and some disallow
building container images on specific cluster resources such as login nodes.
:::

Apptainer can build container images using instructions from a container definition file.
For example, to build an Ubuntu 24.04 LTS-based container image with the `gfortran` compiler
pre-installed, create the container definition file _fortran-runtime.def_:

:::{code-block} shell
:caption: fortran-runtime.def
bootstrap: docker
from: ubuntu:24.04

%post
    apt-get -y update
    apt-get -y install gfortran

%test
    gfortran --version
    exit 0
:::

Now use `apptainer build`{l=shell} to build the container image:

:::{terminal}
:copy:
:host: login

apptainer build fortran-runtime.sif fortran-runtime.def
:::

The built container image can now be used to compile and run Fortran workloads. For
example, create a simple Fortran program the prints "Hello world!" in the file _hello.f90_:

:::{code-block} fortran
:caption: hello.f90
PROGRAM hello_world
  IMPLICIT NONE
  PRINT *, "Hello world!"
END PROGRAM hello_world
:::

Now use the built container to compile and run your Fortran program:

:::{terminal}
:copy:
:host: login

apptainer exec fortran-runtime.sif gfortran --output hello hello.f90
:::

:::{terminal}
:copy:
:host: login

apptainer exec fortran-runtime.sif ./hello

Hello world!
:::

## Provide your workload's runtime environment

Apptainer can provide the runtime environment for your workloads.
The sections below demonstrate the different ways Apptainer can provide
your workload's runtime environment.

### Using the `apptainer`{l=shell} command directly in your workload

The `apptainer`{l=shell} command can be called directly in scripts to perform operations
inside a container instance. First, declare in your batch script the partition you want your
workload to run within and call the `apptainer`{l=shell} command from directly within your script.
For example, to select `compute` as the partition your workload will run within, and run some
Python code using a containerized Python 3.13 interpreter, create the batch script _job.batch_:

:::{code-block} shell
:caption: job.batch
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#SBATCH --partition compute
#SBATCH --output job.out

apptainer pull python-3.13.sif docker://ubuntu/python:3.13-25.04
apptainer --silent exec python-3.13.sif \
  python3 -c 'import sys; print(f"Hello from Python {sys.version}!")'
:::

Now submit the _job.batch_ script to Slurm with `sbatch`{l=shell}:

:::{terminal}
:copy:
:host: login

sbatch job.batch

Submitted batch job 1
:::

Use `cat`{l=shell} to view the results of your workload after it completes:

:::{terminal}
:copy:
:host: login

cat job.out

Hello from Python 3.13.3 (main, Aug 14 2025, 11:53:40) [GCC 14.2.0]!
:::

[//]: # (TODO: Uncomment once https://github.com/charmed-hpc/slurm-charms/issues/143 is fixed.)
<!--
### Using the `--container` flag with `sbatch`{l=shell}

Declare in your batch script's front matter both the partition you want your workload to run within
and the container that will provide the runtime environment of your workload. For example, to create
a batch script with `compute ` selected as the partition your workload will run
within, and use a container with Python 3.13 pre-installed as the runtime environment:

:::{code-block} shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#SBATCH --partition compute
#SBATCH --container docker://ubuntu/python:3.13-25.04
#SBATCH --output stdout-%j.log

python3 --version
:::

Now submit your batch script using the `sbatch`{l=shell} command:

:::{terminal}
:copy:
:host: login

sbatch my-job.batch
:::
-->

### Using the `--container` flag with `srun`{l=shell}

Jobs submitted to Slurm with `srun`{l=shell} can be run inside a container instance using Apptainer.
First, declare both the partition you want your workload to run within and the container image
that will be used by Apptainer to provide the runtime environment of your workload.
For example, to select `compute` as the partition your workload will run within,
and use an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS container image as the runtime environment:

:::{terminal}
:copy:
:host: login

PARTITION=slurmd
:::

:::{terminal}
:copy:
:host: login

CONTAINER=docker://ubuntu:22.04
:::

Now run your workload with `srun`{l=shell}:

:::{terminal}
:copy:
:host: login

srun --partition $PARTITION --container $CONTAINER cat /etc/os-release | grep ^VERSION
